# Market, Users, Prototype

## Understand Your Market
*Provide links to the 3 websites you explored*

>**AirBnb - https://www.airbnb.com/**
>
>**VRBO - https://www.vrbo.com/**
>
>**Booking.com - https://www.booking.com/**

*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison*

>**My goal is to find vacation rental websites that are popular in our target market, and I mainly looked for the top 3 rental websites that are used by customers: Airbnb, VRBO, and Booking.com. Since these sites are the most popular, they'll contain features that customers value and expect to see on their ideal type of vacation rental website. Once we find those ideal features, we can implement it to the Marriott Bonvoy site to ensure our site will be efficient, relevant, and satisfactory to our users.**

*List at least 10 product features*

>**1. Users have access to a very large navbar on the types of rental homes that they can select (cabins, beachfront, lake, trending, towers, arctic etc.).**
>
>**2. Users are given a map with many location icons. Selecting the different icons reveals exactly where a rental spot is located.**
>
>**3. Users are given a large filter to find the proper rental home for their needs while browsing a specific city or area (amenities, property type, property rating, review score, brands, # of rooms and beds, etc.).**
>
>**4. When broswing many locations at once, users can scroll through the 
 thumbnail images of each place and see more visuals of it.**
>
>**5. Users can view and add reviews under the rental home.**
>
>**6. Users have access to an entire Help Center that answers questions about concerns they have and a way to reach someone for help (account settings, privacy, security, refunds, rewards program, etc.).**
>
>**7. Users can choose a check-in and check-out date as well as the number of guests coming with them. It even asks the ages of the guests and if you heve a pet or service animal.**
>
>**8. When a user uses the search bar, a small option pops up that asks them what region in the world they are interested in visiting.**
>
>**9. Users have a button to see the prices per night or the total price amount (before taxes) depending on how many nights they stay.**
>
>**10. Once a user is ready to book, they are given the choice to edit the date and guests before booking. They also have the option to pay in full now or to pay monthly.**


## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*
>**The user research suggests that customers need more in-depth info about a place; starting points/inpsiration for they type of trip they want; and an easier way to navigate through the different locations and the map. Both the survey and the video users want more options to help them find inspiration for a trip or a destination based on the type of trip they want. In addtion, one of the main pain points shown in the video is that the destinations lack info about why they're popular or what you can do at a certain location. Users will want a way to find destinations based on their personal preference and more information about what makes a certain destination special to help them do research on their dream trips. Plus, the map section of the site seemed very overbearing and needs to simplified to make it easier to navigate.**
