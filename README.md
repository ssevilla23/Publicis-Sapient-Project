# üíº Publicis-Sapient Project
The Publicis-Sapient project was a simulated academic experience that
enhanced my web development skill set and provided me insight into working
in UX Research. In this project, my ‚Äúclient‚Äù‚ÄìMarriott Homes & Villas‚Äìwanted
to improve their website‚Äôs user experience by updating certain features.

My role included three main tasks:

1. **User Experience Research**: my first task was to analyze the users' feedback
on the website to understand areas that fell short on meeting their
expectations. I documented these issues to find an underlying theme
within all their comments and then proceeded to research features from
popular vacation rental sites that could potentially increase user
satisfaction if implemented.
2. **Prototype Development**: I then created a small prototype
that mimicked some new features, such as a pop-up menu
allowing users to choose their desired destination from
three categories, which would then generate a list of vacation
homes in that area. Interacting with the listings would then
pull up the location on a map.
3. **Implementation**: Once the prototype was finalized,
I implemented these features into the actual website using JavaScript.
